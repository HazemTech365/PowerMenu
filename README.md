## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Limitations

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Known%20Issues-Yes-critical" alt="Known Issues">

> These are not user-reported bugs, but important things to be aware of:

- **UEFI Required for Full Features:** Some settings and options may be unavailable on systems using Legacy BIOS. UEFI is strongly recommended.

- **Administrator Rights Needed:** The app may fail to function properly if not run as Administrator. For best results, right-click and choose **"Run as administrator"**.

- **Windows-Only (For Now):** This tool is currently built for Windows systems only. Support for Linux/macOS may come later.

- **Antivirus False Positives:** Some antivirus programs may flag the executable due to its use of system-level commands. Rest assured, the tool is clean.


- **Display Scaling Issues:** On some systems with custom DPI settings, UI elements may not appear properly scaled. A fix is planned for a future version.

This list will expand as we discover more edge cases or system-specific quirks.

## üîß Build from Source

To build **PowerMenu** from source, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Install [AutoIt v3](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads/) (version 3.3.14.5 or later recommended).
   - Optional but recommended: Install [SciTE4AutoIt3](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit-tools/scite4autoit3/) for a powerful AutoIt IDE and editor.
   - Ensure you have a Windows development environment (Windows 10/11 recommended).

2. **Clone the Repository:**
    
        git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/PowerMenu.git
        cd PowerMenu

3. **Compile the Script:**
   - Open `PowerMenu.au3` in SciTE4AutoIt3 or your preferred editor.
   - Press **F7** (Compile Script) to build the executable.
   - Alternatively, you can use the command line AutoIt compiler:
    
        "C:\Program Files (x86)\AutoIt3\Aut2Exe\Aut2exe.exe" /in PowerMenu.au3 /out PowerMenu.exe

   - The compiled executable `PowerMenu.exe` will be generated in the project directory.

4. **Verify the Build:**
   - Run `PowerMenu.exe` and ensure all features (shutdown, reboot, Safe Mode options) function as expected.

5. **Customization:**
   - Modify `PowerMenu.au3` source code to tweak features or add custom options.
   - Recompile after changes to apply updates.

6. **Distributing your Build:**
   - Include any necessary assets or configuration files along with the executable.
   - Make sure to comply with the original license and give proper credit.
