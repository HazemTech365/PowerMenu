Or clone this repository manually:

```bash

```

After cloning or visiting the [Releases page](https://github.com/HazemTech365/PowerMenu/releases), just:

---

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

Having issues? Here are some quick fixes:

- ⚙️ **Safe Mode options not working?**  
  > Make sure you're running PowerMenu with **Administrator privileges** to allow boot-level changes like entering Safe Mode.  
  > Right-click → “Run as administrator”.

- ⚡ **Shutdown or Restart doesn’t happen right away?**  
  > If **Fast Startup** is enabled, Windows might delay or override shutdown commands.  
  > Disable it via:  
  > *Control Panel → Power Options → Choose what the power buttons do → Change settings that are currently unavailable → Uncheck "Turn on fast startup"*

- 🌀 **Stuck in Safe Mode after reboot?**  
  > Don’t worry — **PowerMenu auto-detects Safe Mode** and will prompt you to exit it automatically when you launch the app.  
  > No manual command needed — just open PowerMenu and reboot normally.

- 🧪 **Still stuck manually?**  
  > Open **Command Prompt as Administrator** and run:  
  > `bcdedit /deletevalue {current} safeboot`
