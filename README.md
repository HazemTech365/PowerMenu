## 🛠 Troubleshooting  
![Troubleshooting Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Help-Fast_Start_&_Safe_Mode_Tips-007ec6?style=flat)

Having issues? Here are some quick fixes:

- ⚙️ **Safe Mode options not working?**  
  > Make sure you're running PowerMenu with **Administrator privileges**.  
  > Right-click → “Run as administrator”.

- ⚡ **Shutdown or Restart doesn’t happen right away?**  
  > If **Fast Startup** is enabled, Windows might delay shutdown commands.  
  > Disable it via:  
  > *Control Panel → Power Options → Choose what the power buttons do → Change settings that are currently unavailable → Uncheck "Turn on fast startup"*

- 🌀 **Stuck in Safe Mode after reboot?**  
  > PowerMenu auto-detects Safe Mode and will prompt to exit it. Just reopen the app and reboot.

- 🧪 **Still stuck manually?**  
  > Open **Command Prompt as Administrator** and run:  
  > `bcdedit /deletevalue {current} safeboot`

<div id="known-issues"></div>

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Limitations

> These are not user-reported bugs, but important things to be aware of:

- **UEFI Required for Full Features:** Some settings and options may be unavailable on systems using Legacy BIOS. UEFI is strongly recommended.

- **Administrator Rights Needed:** The app may fail to function properly if not run as Administrator. For best results, right-click and choose **"Run as administrator"**.

- **Windows-Only (For Now):** This tool is currently built for Windows systems only. Support for Linux/macOS may come later.

- **Antivirus False Positives:** Some antivirus software might flag the executable due to the use of certain system-level commands. Rest assured, the tool is clean.

- **No Offline Mode (Yet):** Certain features may require an active internet connection (depending on your version).

- **Display Scaling Issues:** On some systems with custom DPI settings, UI elements may not appear properly scaled. A fix is planned for a future version.

This list will expand as we discover more edge cases or system-specific quirks.

## ❓ FAQ

![FAQ Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/FAQ-Questions-007ec6?style=flat)

**Q: Why do I need to run PowerMenu as Administrator for Safe Mode?**  
A: Changing Safe Mode settings requires system-level permissions, so admin rights are necessary for those commands to work.

**Q: Does PowerMenu support Windows 7?**  
A: PowerMenu is tested and confirmed on Windows 8, 10, and 11. Windows 7 support isn’t officially guaranteed — it might work, but some features could be missing or behave unexpectedly.

**Q: Can I customize the PowerMenu UI?**  
A: Currently, PowerMenu uses a fixed clean interface. UI customization might be added in future releases.

**Q: Is installation required?**  
A: Nope! PowerMenu is portable — just download and run the `.exe`. No install needed.

**Q: Is this safe to run? Why does my antivirus warn me?**  
A: PowerMenu is 100% clean and open-source. Some antivirus tools may flag AutoIt EXEs due to how they interact with system commands. You can always inspect the code or build from source.
